## Details


Crime forecasting model is created using auto-arime model to forecast the crimes. We have used the Sindh Crime dataset collected by LUMS university. We performed some preprocessing on this data and then we performed different tests like adi-fuller to check whether data is stationary or not. After this we performed auto-arima model on data.
